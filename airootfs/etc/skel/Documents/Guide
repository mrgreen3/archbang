PACMAN (LIVE SESSION)

To use pacman or a browser in the live session, you need a working network connection.

- Wired (Ethernet) connections work automatically.
- Wireless connections can be configured via the network icon on the panel:
  - Left-click the icon
  - Select your network from the list
  - Enter your Wi-Fi password

---

INSTALLATION

To begin installation:

1. Right-click on the desktop
2. Select Install from the main menu

The installer is menu-driven and easy to follow.

Need help with partitions?
Use GParted, available in the labwc menu under Settings or via the Waybar launcher.

POST-INSTALL STEPS
##################

MICROCODE NOTICE

WayBang includes both intel-ucode and amd-ucode microcode packages to support a wide range of CPUs.

You only need one, depending on your processor.

Important: If you remove a microcode package after installation, and your bootloader references it, your system may fail to boot.
Only remove the unused one if you are comfortable editing your bootloader entries.

After removal, update your bootloader configuration to reflect the change (e.g., regenerate GRUB or edit loader.conf if using systemd-boot).

ENSURE YOU HAVE A NETWORK CONNECTION

Refer to the instructions in the Pacman Live section above if needed.

INITIALIZE PACMAN

pacman will not work until keys are initialized. Run the following:

ab-pacman-keys

This will:

- Create keys
- Refresh the package cache
- Update the archlinux-keyring

---

BASIC PACKAGE USAGE

Search for packages:

sudo pacman -Ss <package-name>

Install a package:

sudo pacman -S <package-name>

---

INSTALLATION TIPS AND TRICKS

If your live session runs out of disk space, you can remount the live filesystem with more space:

sudo mount -o remount,size=8G /run/archiso/cowspace

INTEL GRAPHICS ON WAYBANG

WayBang uses Wayland with labwc, which relies on kernel modesetting drivers (via Mesa).

No additional Intel graphics drivers are needed for Wayland - the built-in kernel drivers handle graphics acceleration directly.

This provides better performance and eliminates tearing issues common with older Xorg drivers.
