POST-INSTALL STEPS
##################

MICROCODE NOTICE

ArchBANG includes both intel-ucode and amd-ucode microcode packages to support a wide range of CPUs.

You only need one, depending on your processor.

Important: If you remove a microcode package after installation, and your bootloader references it, your system may fail to boot.
Only remove the unused one if you are comfortable editing your bootloader entries.

After removal, update your bootloader configuration to reflect the change (e.g., regenerate GRUB or edit loader.conf if using systemd-boot).

ENSURE YOU HAVE A NETWORK CONNECTION

Refer to the instructions in the Pacman Live section above if needed.

INITIALIZE PACMAN

pacman will not work until keys are initialized. Run the following:

ab-pacman-keys

This will:

- Create keys
- Refresh the package cache
- Update the archlinux-keyring

---

BASIC PACKAGE USAGE

Search for packages:

sudo pacman -Ss <package-name>

Install a package:

sudo pacman -S <package-name>

---

INSTALLATION TIPS AND TRICKS

If your live session runs out of disk space, you can remount the live filesystem with more space:

sudo mount -o remount,size=8G /run/archiso/cowspace

INTEL GRAPHICS ON ARCHBANG

ArchBang does not include the legacy xf86-video-intel driver by default.

On most Intel systems (Sandy Bridge / 2011 and newer), Xorg will use the built-in modesetting driver (via Mesa), which is generally the best option.

QUICK FIX (OLDER INTEL IGPUs)

If you see poor performance, tearing in Xorg, or a black screen on very old Intel hardware, install the legacy driver and reboot:

sudo pacman -S xf86-video-intel
