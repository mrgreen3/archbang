ArchBang based on Labwc and Wayland

Updated theme, any additions?

check new conky colors and layout [increased font]

Maybe look at coloured headers? from mocha theme

Added gparted keybind, will then need to remove it from rc.xml post install!!!!

Installer simplification (target: late Feb):
- Merge Hostname, Locale, and Keyboard Layout into single "System Configuration" step
- Rename getxkeymap() to get_desktop_keymap() (remove X11 legacy naming)
- Implement console keymap setup (currently getkeymap() is unused)
- Set both console and desktop keyboard layouts in one step
- Reduce installer from 8 steps to 5-6 steps
- Consider auto-detect timezone option (if reliable network available)
