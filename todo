ArchBang based on Labwc and Wayland

wmenu - lightweight launcher fits well with labwc's dynamic menu, rofi would be overkill

Remaining tasks:
- check new conky colors and layout [increased font]
- Maybe look at coloured headers? from mocha theme
- Review gparted keybind in rc.xml (post install consideration)

Installer simplification (target: late Feb):
- Merge Hostname, Locale, and Keyboard Layout into single "System Configuration" step
- Rename getxkeymap() to get_desktop_keymap() (remove X11 legacy naming)
- Implement console keymap setup (currently getkeymap() is unused)
- Set both console and desktop keyboard layouts in one step
- Reduce installer from 8 steps to 5-6 steps
- Consider auto-detect timezone option (if reliable network available)
